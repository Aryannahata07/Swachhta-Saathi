        <h3>How Our Website Promotes Waste Segregation with a Unique Reward System</h3>
        <p>
            Waste segregation is an essential part of managing waste responsibly, and at Saahas Zero Waste, we have taken innovative steps to ensure that our communities and users understand its importance.
            Our platform encourages users to segregate their waste at source by offering rewards for proper waste disposal. Hereâ€™s how our system works:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Segregation at Source:</strong> We educate users about the importance of segregating waste into recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable categories. Our user-friendly platform provides guidelines for proper segregation.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Waste Disposal:</strong> Our system tracks how much waste each user disposes of correctly. For every kilogram of properly segregated waste, users earn points that can be redeemed for rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Reward System:</strong> Points earned from proper waste disposal can be used to access discounts on eco-friendly products, services, or donations to environmental causes. This motivates users to participate actively in maintaining cleanliness.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Cleanliness Drives:</strong> We also organize cleanliness drives, and participants earn extra rewards for contributing to these initiatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By engaging users in this rewarding system, we aim to make waste segregation a habit and instill a sense of responsibility toward maintaining cleanliness. Every small action contributes to the larger goal of zero waste!
